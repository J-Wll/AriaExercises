      <h4>Reasons for changes</h4>
      <p>
        The original buttons are made of a modified span tag within HTML, this
        is bad practice as it requires defining additional attributes that are
        inherently present in the native, semantic tag of button. These
        attributes, if configured incorrectly would lead to accessibility
        problems for some users.
      </p>
      <p>
        Changing the span tag to a button and removing the now unnecessary
        attributes not only makes the HTML more clear but makes sure that the
        best practice and widely used roles, states and attributes are used.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another change was in the colouring of the suggested replacement button,
        slightly lightening the background and darkening the text. This slight
        change in colours maintains the original design ethos yet is enough to
        enhance the contrast ratio past the specified AA and AAA contrast
        standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        While this slight change may not be picked up by many users, it might
        make a significant difference for those less-abled in terms of vision.
