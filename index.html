            <h2>ARIA Exercises</h2>
            <p>During your career as a developer or designer, you may come across some crazy looking code. Your task may
                include correcting the code to make it pass accessibility or usability tests, but in some cases,
                you will not be able to make 'breaking changes', so will
                only be able to adapt the code, or add to it and not change it entirely. With this in mind, the
                exercises below put you in the role of a developer. In some cases, you will be asked to modify existing
                code and make suggestions, in others you will be asked to rewrite code as you see fit. <em>Do not break
                    the page to fix the code</em> </p>
            <p> You can either modify the code in this HTML document or click the link labelled <em>Code</em> to
                download the section associated with it. Follow the instructions and do your best.</p>

                <h3>1. Making unusual code accessible using ARIA</h3>
                <figure>
                    <img src="./images/not_interesting.png" alt="The developer console in chrome">
                    <figcaption>Image showing the developer console, with the accessibility tab open.
                        The span element is highlighted and its node in the accessibility tree is shown on the right
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>The buttons below, labelled button 1, button 2 etc., are marked 'not interesting for accessibility'
                    in the accessibility tab of your
                    developer console. Your team cannot access the buttons easily with JavaScript, your client is not
                    happy that disabled clients can't 'see' or use the buttons in an accessible way and your manager,
                    who doesn't know a thing about html, tells you that <em>you cannot change the elements</em>, so you
                    cannot just change the content entirely, but you can add attributes to it. In his words,
                    <q>Just make it work!</q>
                </p>
                <p>With these restrictions in mind: </p>
                <p><strong>a. </strong>Using 'role',and 'aria-label' ARIA attributes, and 'id' and 'tabindex' attributes
                    , make these poorly coded buttons accessible, selectable without a mouse and easily usable in
                    JavaScript.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>b. </strong>These buttons will not pass the AA standard of WCAG, but your client doesn't
                    want the buttons to
                    look too different from the way they do now. Find out what's wrong, after adding the content above,
                    and correct it, <em>without making drastic changes</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>c. </strong>You know better, but you should be gracious and helpful. Below the
                    'button-group' section, create a new section
                    containing the same buttons, with the heading 'Suggested replacements', designed with the most
                    efficient HTML and CSS that will negate the need for some of the ARIA landmarks and attributes, will
                    look the same, if not, very similar, will pass accessibility tests and give the team access to the
                    buttons in the same way.
                </p>
                <p><strong>d. </strong>You might know better, but you still have to explain yourself. Below your new
                    button
                    group, add an article. Using clean HTML code, clearly justify why your solution is better than the
                    provided code in a professional manner, using the sources that prove you are right and the original
                    code is
                    wrong. A few words <em>will not cut it.</em></p>

                <h3>2. Add ARIA landmarks to a user form</h3>
                <figure>
                    <img src="./images/visual-impairment-simulation-goggles.jpg" alt="Visual impairment">
                    <figcaption>Visual impairment affects nearly 300 million people worldwide. The image shows some
                        people trying to read a document wearing visual impairment simulation goggles</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Your client, an optician, wants a contact form for users to book sight tests. The client is very
                    conscious of the fact that many of his customers may have problems with their vision, including
                    Myopia, Hyperopia, Protanopia, Deuteranopia, Tritanopia and Retinal degeneration of other kinds.</p>
                <p>As well as this, the client wants to be competitive, and not have a boring, black and white site, so
                    that those without visual acuities are presented with a vibrant page. As such, the client has
                    provided 3 probable colour schemes for you to use in creating the form.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="./images/color-schemes.png" alt="Colour schemes">
                    <figcaption>The client has chosen three vibrant colour schemes. Adapt the colour selections from one
                        of the groups, ensuring the output is accessible</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>The contact form will contain the following fields: First name, Surname, email, phone number,
                    Postcode, Message, Appointment Date, Appointment time. </p>
                <p>The Opticians' opening hours are Monday to Saturday, 8:30am to 5:30pm and appointments are <em>always
                        half hour slots</em></p>
                <p><strong>a. </strong>Because you don't know the terms they're
                    referring to, you'll probably have no idea how to accomplish the task. Find out what each of the
                    visual impairments described above means. Add a group of articles below your form that details each
                    of the problems, how it affects users and what you have done in your form to alleviate your clients
                    concerns.</p>

                <p><strong>b.</strong> A simple form has already been created below by the client. Modify and add to it
                    to accomplish the goals set by them, adding the required fields as described. <em>
                        Ensure it meets reasonable accessibility standards.
                    </em> Test your code to ensure it is
                    accessible</p>
                <p><strong>c. </strong> ARIA landmarks are not always required, but in this form, the button group
                    should be assessed according to the authoring practices <a
                        href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/radiobutton/">example</a>.
                    Follow the link, read the example, implement it in the form.

                </p>
                <p><strong>d. </strong> Finish the form by styling and colouring it in a professional manner, adapting
                    any
                    one of the colour schemes shown.</p>

                <h3>Fix bad ARIA practices</h3>
                <p>Ok, you've just started a new role. Great! Unfortunately, the previous employee had just heard about
                    ARIA and before he left, decided to add the kitchen sink to every element he could find on the last
                    bit of work he completed. It's your job to fix the code full of confusing, incorrect and unnecessary
                    roles, landmarks and states, and simplify the code.</p>
                <p><strong>a. </strong> Have a look at the html and find each bad practice. There are five rules of
                    ARIA, you need to find which rule was broken and describe how the rule was broken. Do this in
                    articles below the fixed code.
                </p>
                <p><strong>b. </strong>fix the code. Remove the invalid and incorrect ARIA code so that the document is
                    using the correct landmarks where needed and doesn't have them where it isn't needed</p>
                <p><strong>c. </strong> Removing the landmarks is definitely not going to fully correct this document.
                    Ensure that the correct semantic tags are being used to correctly identify the types of content.
                    Ensure that the styling remains consistent, <em>do not break the layout when you fix the code</em>
